During my journey in the ODIN project I have learned and practiced several
basics of HTML and using GITHUB or about commiting

Things I have leaned about HTML(HYPERTEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE)
-Controls layout content
-How to create the main template of HTML and the utf-8 meta tag
-provide structurefor the web design
-crafts the fundamentals for building blocks
-Tags and Attributes
-Paragraph and heading types
-Lists
-Images, Links and the types of images

Basically we use HTML to create all paragraphs, headings, lists, images and
links that make up a typical weboage
